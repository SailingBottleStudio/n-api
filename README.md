# N-API utils for Sailing Bottle Studio codebase

This module is based heavily on the works of [raub](https://github.com/node-3d/addon-tools-raub).

I could have used his work, but it focuses on emulating the web APIs, and we just want to access low level APIs with as tiny as possible of JS glue code.
